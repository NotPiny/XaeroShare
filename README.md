A simple client side mod that allows you to share [Xaero's Minimap](https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-minimap) waypoints to specific players instead of being forced into sharing it with all players currently online the server.

Current features:
* Sharing waypoints with single and or multiple players
* Automatic delay between sending waypoints to avoid spamming commands
